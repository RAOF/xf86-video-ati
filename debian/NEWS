xserver-xorg-video-ati (1:6.7.197-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The X.Org ATI driver supports RandR 1.2 which enables dynamic
    enabling, disabling, resizing, rotating, placing, ... of multiple
    outputs at runtime. You might want to update your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    accordingly. See http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
    and http://www.intellinuxgraphics.org/dualhead.html for some help.
