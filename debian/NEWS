xserver-xorg-video-ati (1:6.8.1~git20080301.1f6a2300-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The 'ati' Xorg driver module does not contain the 'r128' and 'mach64'
    submodule anymore. Users of Rage or Mach boards should replace
    Driver 'ati' with 'r128' or 'mach64' in their /etc/X11/xorg.conf.

xserver-xorg-video-ati (1:6.7.197-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The X.Org ATI driver supports RandR 1.2 which enables dynamic
    enabling, disabling, resizing, rotating, placing, ... of multiple
    outputs at runtime. You might want to update your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
    accordingly. See http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
    and http://www.intellinuxgraphics.org/dualhead.html for some help.
